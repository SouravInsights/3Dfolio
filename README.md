# 3Dfolio - Portfolio theme for 3D Makers.

3Dfolio is a portfolio template for 3D designers to showcase their 3D models in an interactive 3D player built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/).

> Designers don't necessarily code and 3Dfolio is built with that in mind.

3Dfolio comes with pre configured [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) content model so that you can just forget about the code and manage your entire content from GraphCMS's intuitive dashboard. You can also see a demo video very soon about how you can get started with **3Dfolio** and **GraphCMS**.
